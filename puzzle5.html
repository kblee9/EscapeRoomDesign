<h1>Daedalus' Laptop</h1>
<hr>
<p class="nar">After completing the puzzle, someone shouts that they found something else. You turn around to see the person return from the alcove with... a computer? This daedalus guy sure was way ahead of his time. You're certain that if there is a way out of here it would be on the creator's laptop, so you open up the computer carefully to find that it still has a charge (a miracle considering the lack of electricity they had back then). The downside is, that there is a password needed to get in. You try imputing 'Daedalus'. Wrong. But the computer offers you a hint. Of course, you click it to see.</p>

<p class="nar">You look to your left to see a pair of half finished wings you had noticed when you first stepped into the room, and then to your right at the 'Fall of Icarus' painting you had just finished putting back together.</p>
