<p><strong>ATTENTION!</strong> During a tour of the statue of Liberty, a group of tourists stumbled upon a previously undiscovered entrance to Daedalus' Labyrinth and trapped themselves inside. As we know, many objects from countless mythologies still exist today in their own modern renditions and it is our job as Magicians to sort out any problems that occur along the way. If you are receiving this alert, you have been selected as one of the Magicians for this assignment. You will be sent into the Labyrinth to help these civilians escape. A tip: find Daedalus' office, there's sure to be helpful tools in there. May Tyche bless you with fortune, good luck!</p>
