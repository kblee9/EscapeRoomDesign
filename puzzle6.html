<h1>Decode a Message</h1>
<hr>

<p class="nar">The password worked! You immediately begin searching through notes and files for anything that could be a clue. After digging through countless documents, you come across one that contains some sort of key? You recognize some of the characters from the strange writing on the walls when you first stepped into the Labyrinth. Immediately you tell the group what you found, and with the computer in hand, you all venture back out into the maze's tunnels to follow the string back to where you can from.</p>

<p class="nar">Upon returning to the other end of the string, you all start scoping the walls for anything that stands out amongst the other paintings. A lot of the writing is covered by a painting, but one phrase stands out clear on a wall entirely on its own. Deciding this must be it, you open the computer again and pull the key back up to begin decoding.</p>
