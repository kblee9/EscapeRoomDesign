<h1>An Ancient Heist</h1>
<hr>

<p style="font-size: 20px">As soon as the final stone was pressed, the whole wall shudders before slowly moving aside to reveal a huge room. There was one large table covered in papers and diagrams, another table on the far wall covered with miscellaneous items, and what looked like half-finished projects just laying about the entire room. It looked like one, extremely messy office. This must be where Daedalus worked on his inventions! While everyone explores the space, you notice a strange spot in the wall. It's a perfect circle. Puzzled, you announce it to the room and suggest everyone start looking for circular objects that might fit in the spot.<br>
  After much searching, three people bring to you one item each. The first person found an old cretan coin, the second found an ancient discus, and the third a large ring. You lay all three items out onto a clear spot on a table and decide which to try first. </p>

    <p>You pick up the coin, turning it over in your hands to inspect the ancient carvings before bringing it to the wall. With a sigh, you realize the coin is way too small and does not fit into the spot in the wall. Dejected, you go back to the items to try again.</p>

    <h2>The Disc</h2><hr>
  </div>
    <p>You pick up the disc, almost dropping it in the process due to its weight. Oops. You struggle to lift it up to the space in the wall, but once you do you realize it is much too big and simply does not fit. Careful to not crush your toes, you go back to the items to try again. </p>

    <h2>The Ring</h2><hr>
  </div>
    <p>You pick up the ring and inspect it first. It's much too large to be a bracelet, a little too bulky to be a necklace, and definitely not a crown, although it probably could fit on your head. If this was the bull ring in the Minotaur's nose... you definitely wouldn't want to meet him. 
      You take the ring up to the wall and fit it into the spot. It fit! The ring clicks into place and the spot in the wall glows once before the wall starts sliding open to reveal a hidden alcove filled with things. </p>
